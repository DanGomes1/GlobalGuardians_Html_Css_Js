            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>Climate Change</h4>
            <p class="maincontent">
                Since the industrial and scientific revolutions, Earth's resources have been gradually depleted.
                Additionally, the world's population explosion is placing a significant strain on the environment. <br><br>
                Simply said, when the population grows, there is a corresponding rise in the consumption of natural resources as well as the waste that results from their usage.
                <br><br> Climate change has been one of the key effects of this over the years.
                Climate change includes changes in rain cycles, wind patterns, cyclone frequency, sea levels, and other factors in addition to changes in global temperature. It has an impact on all major life forms on the planet.

            </p>
            <h4>Global Warming: What Is It?</h4>
            <p class="maincontent">
                Earth has seen several cycles of warming and cooling over its lengthy history.
                The planet's climate has evolved as a result of small orbital changes, changes to the atmosphere, and surface changes or when the energy of the Sun changed.
                 However, throughout the past century, humanity has begun to exert its own effect on the planet's climate.<br><br>
                
                 The extremely quick rise in Earth's average surface temperature is known as global warming. This impact typically develops over a lengthy period of time, but because of the recent world events, it has happened considerably faster.
                 Despite the fact that there have been many instances of global warming throughout history, research on the subject indicate that the current pace of temperature rise is unnatural and is mostly caused by an increase in the use of fossil fuels.
                 This is quite alarming because, if this problem is not resolved, it might have catastrophic effects for all life on Earth.</p>

            <h3>Global Warming: How It Happens?</h3>
               <h4>Greenhouse Effects</h2>
                <figure>
                <img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/subscriber.images/biology/2017/12/04052838/Greenhouse-Effect.png" alt="Greenhouse Effect inforgraphic" class="graphsandimages">
                <figcaption>This inforgraphic summarises the how the greenhouse effect occurs.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h5>a) Natural Greenhouse Effect</h5>
                <p class="maincontent">
                    The Sun is the source of all heat on Earth. Bright objects like clouds and ice reflect about 30% of the incoming sunlight back into space. The land, oceans, and atmosphere all absorb the majority of the remaining seventy percent. The sun energy that is absorbed warms our world.
                    The rocks, the air, and the oceans emit "heat" energy as they warm (thermal infrared radiation).<br><br>
                    This heat energy is discharged from the surface into the atmosphere, where long-lived greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane absorb a considerable percentage of it.
                    When they absorb the energy emitted from the Earth's surface, microscopic water or greenhouse gas molecules function as mini heaters; like fireplace bricks, they continue to radiate heat even after the fire has been out. In every direction, they dispersed. 
                    <br><br> Both the surface and the lower atmosphere are warmed by the heat that returns to Earth, enhancing the warmth they get from direct sunlight.            
                    The natural greenhouse effect, or the atmosphere's absorption and radiation of heat, is advantageous for life on Earth. The average surface temperature of the Earth would be exceedingly cold without the greenhouse effect.</p>
                <h5>b) Evolved Greenhouse Effect</h5>
                <p class="maincontent">
                    Scientists are increasingly concerned that during the past 250 years, people have unnaturally increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at an ever-increasing rate, mostly via the combustion of fossil fuels but also by the clearing of carbon-absorbing forests. As of 2009, methane(CH<sub>4</sub>) levels had climbed by 148% and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels had risen by almost 38% since the start of the Industrial Revolution sometime around 1750.
                <br><br>
                   More greenhouse gas molecules are present in the atmosphere now, which causes more of the infrared radiation generated by the surface to be absorbed by it. The temperature of the Earth's surface increases because part of the excess energy from a warmer atmosphere reflects back down to the surface. Hence, we are transforming the Earth's atmosphere into a more effective greenhouse by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>The beginning of the Industrial Revolution, around 1750, was accompanied by an increase in carbon dioxide concentrations (top) and methane concentrations (bottom).

                </figure>
                <h4>Greenhouse Gases Contributors</h4>
                <h5>a) Burning of Fossil Fuels</h5>
                <img src="https://natureworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Fossil-Fuels.jpg" alt="Air Pollution" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">
                    Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels that are now indispensable to our way of life. They are extensively employed in both transportation and the generation of electrical power. As they burn, the carbon that has been stored inside is freed and reacts with the oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide. The number of automobiles has surged along with the population, which has led to an increase in the amount of air pollution. Carbon dioxide, one of the principal gases contributing to an increase in the greenhouse effect, is released when these vehicles are operating.
                    <br><br>
                    The fact that we continue to rely on coal for energy generation, which emits a significant quantity of CO2 into the atmosphere, is another factor contributing to the high emissions associated with electricity. Despite the fact that renewable energy sources are coming up, it could still be some time before we can eliminate our reliance on coal for the production of power.
                </p>
                <h5>b) Deforestation</h5>
                <img src="https://www.srilankafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Deforestation.jpg" alt="Deforestation Image" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">Cutting down forests to make way for farms, pastures, or for other purposes increases emissions because when forests are cleared, the stored carbon is released. An estimated 12 million hectares of forest are cleared annually. Destruction of trees also reduces nature's capacity to keep emissions out of the atmosphere because they absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen via photosynthesis. A quarter percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation.</p>
                <h5>c) Agricultural Activities</h5>
                <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.framfarmers.co.uk%2Fassets%2FUploads%2Fblocks%2Fhero%2F315%2Fshutterstock_37984042__FillWzEwMjAsNzIwXQ.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=9d681bdee02faba8008e24feb103e680a0d87eccef3b92614859661f2994f972&ipo=images" alt="Livestock" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">
                    Another factor contributing to global warming caused by humans is the agricultural methods used to provide food for the planet's inhabitants. Nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, is released with the application of both commercial and organic fertilizers. Another significant greenhouse gas is methane, which is produced by a variety of natural processes including the digestion of cattle reared for food, the decomposition of trash in landfills, and the burning of biomass.

                <h3>Global Warming: What Are The Consequences?</h3>
                <h4>a) Melting Of Ice Caps</h4>
                <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/upload/ab/04/79/iceberg-in-penola-strait-antarctica-6060331625.jpg" alt="Icebergs" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">
                    Melting has been one of the main effects of global warming thus far. A 2016 study that was published in the journal Current Climate Change Reports shows that between 1960 and 2015, snow cover decreased over North America, Europe, and Asia. Permafrost, or permanently frozen ground, has decreased by 10% across the Northern Hemisphere since the early 1900s, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Landslides and other unexpected terrain collapses may result from the melting of permafrost. It can also trigger the thawing of long-buried microorganisms, as happened in a 2016 incident involving a stockpile of reindeer carcasses, which led to an anthrax epidemic.
                <br><br>
                The shrinkage of Arctic sea ice is one of the most striking consequences of global warming. In both the autumn and winter of 2015 and 2016, sea ice extents reached record-low levels, which indicates that the ice lagged at the period when it should have been at its maximum. Less thick sea ice that lasts for several years results from the thaw. According to NASA's Operation IceBridge, this means that less heat is reflected back into the atmosphere by the sparkling surface of the ice and more is absorbed by the relatively darker water, generating a feedback loop that leads to even greater melt.
            <br><br>
            Another clear consequence of global warming is glacial retreat. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that just 25 glaciers larger than 25 acres remain in Montana's Glacier National Park, where 150 glaciers formerly existed. All throughout the world, glacial regions exhibit a comparable pattern. A 2016 research published in the journal Nature Geoscience determined that there is a 99% chance that this quick retreat is driven by human-induced climate change. These researchers discovered that certain glaciers receded up to 15 times more than they would have without global warming.    
            </p>
            <h4>b) Rising Sea Levels</h4>
            <img src="https://s.w-x.co/sealevelrise_0.jpg" alt="Floods" class="graphsandimages">
            <p class="maincontent">
                The term "sea level rise" refers to the rise in ocean levels brought on by the consequences of global warming. After then, the majority of this heat is absorbed by the seas. Water expands as it warms up. Ocean levels rise as a result globally.
                The world's coastal ecosystems are seriously threatened by sea level rise. Storm surges and floods will be more intense, and coastal regions will be damaged. This often includes endangered animal habitats as well as densely populated urban areas. People could therefore be uprooted and forced to look for safer housing. Rising sea levels might pollute soil and groundwater with salt, posing a hazard to life even farther inland. It is challenging to forecast the extent of sea level increase. However, it is important to note patterns in the rising sea levels to better prepare for the consequences. 
            </p>
            <h4>c) Ocean Acidification</h4>
            <img src="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/d/4681/files/2019/09/1280Fig_1_482893.jpg" alt="Coral Reefs" class="graphsandimages">
            <p class="maincontent">
                Ocean acidification is defined as the lowering of pH levels of the ocean and it poses a hazard to all seas, estuaries, and rivers in the globe. It is anticipated to increase as long as carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere remain at record-high levels. Our seas are taking up more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere like a sponge. The seas and marine life, notably shellfish like economically significant oysters and clams, suffer as a result of this exchange, which aids in regulating the planet's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The consequences of ocean acidification on shellfish, which resemble osteoporosis and make it difficult for them to develop and maintain shells, are well recognized. Other species that are essential to the marine ecology, such as pteropods and coral reef-builders, are also impacted by acidification (tiny snails eaten by numerous species such as fish and whales).
            </p>
            <h4>d) Social Effects</h4>
            <img src="https://www.gardenroute.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/drought.jpg" alt="Drought" class="graphsandimages">
            <p class="maincontent">
                The predicted changes to human society may be far more destructive than the expected impacts of climate change on the natural world.
                Agricultural systems will probably suffer a fatal blow. Although some regions' growing seasons will lengthen, a combination of factors including drought, extreme weather, a lack of accumulated snowmelt, an increase in the number and variety of pests, lower groundwater tables, and a loss of arable land could result in severe crop failures and livestock shortages globally.
                Carbon dioxide has an impact on plant development, according to North Carolina State University. Plants may grow larger when exposed to CO2, but they may lose some of their nutritional value.
                <br><br>
                According to a number of analyses from organizations like the U.S. Department of Defense, the Center for American Progress, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, this loss of food security may, in turn, wreck havoc on the world's food markets and could cause famines, food riots, political instability, and civil unrest everywhere.
                In addition to food that is less nutrient-dense, the impact of global warming on human health is anticipated to be significant. The American Medical Association has seen an increase in chronic disorders like asthma as well as mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, most likely as a direct effect of global warming.

                <h3>Global Warming: How Do We Remedy It?</h3>
                <h4>a) Reforestation</h4>
                <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fecofuneral.ca%2F7442%2FFull%2FiStock_000025377383_Large.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=e0007bd33eee4a92fbd66bc4b0a3937a74e2220467ea7b1c424db4a0e918e6c9&ipo=images" alt="Reforestation" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">
                    According to studies presented at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, reforestation is the most affordable method of halting global warming.
                    Planting more trees can help lower the quantity of carbon in our atmosphere because plants absorb carbon dioxide, which accounts for 82% of the greenhouse gases in our environment. In fact, a research that was published in the journal of Science found that we could get rid of around two-thirds of human-made carbon simply by allowing all trees to regenerate.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, tropical forests in nations like Brazil, Indonesia, and India will effectively remove carbon from the atmosphere due to their abundance of biodiversity and important roles in the planet's air and water cycles, according to a report published in Science Advances.
                    Therefore, we should work towards replanting trees in forests that have been cleared as well as advocate for the preservation of existing forests. 
                </p>
                <h4>b) Reduce Usage of Fossil Fuels </h4>
                <img src="https://www.promain.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/cache/2017/08/shutterstock_368380064/2941541252.jpg" alt="Power Plant" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">
                    To combat climate change, we must drastically reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, which has a high carbon content. This procedure can be started in a variety of ways. Not constructing any new coal-burning power plants and slowly shutting down some, starting with the oldest and dirtiest ones, is a crucial action step. Another is collecting and storing carbon emissions from power plants. The technology to bury carbon emissions underground exists, despite the fact that it could seem fictional. Although the technique has not been widely used or shown to be secure and long-lasting, it has been shown to work in other situations, such as oil and natural gas recovery. It is worthwhile to pursue demonstration projects to examine the practicality and economics of this technology for reducing emissions from power plants.
                </p>
                <h4>c) Exploring Other Energy Sources</h4>
                <h5>i. Renewable Energy</h5>
                <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.speccorporation.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F12%2FAdobeStock_172956774-scaled.jpeg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=5dfeb919a417d4a2ab0649d45f56dbf6e825e9a12b92b69d003ad5b4f38e883d&ipo=images" alt="Renewable Energy" class="graphsandimages">
                <p class="maincontent">
                    The globe has access to renewable energy sources including sun, wind, geothermal, and bioenergy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the technological capability of renewable energy to supply the great majority of our energy requirements. Rapid deployment, rising cost-effectiveness, and job creation are all advantages of renewable energy technology.
                </p>
                <h5>ii. Nuclear Energy</h5>

                    Since nuclear energy produces few greenhouse gas emissions, increasing its fraction in the energy mix could help address global warming. However, nuclear technology poses serious risks to our security as well as to our health and the environment, as the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has shown. The big question is: Can the constraints to nuclear power's safety, proliferation, waste management, and cost be removed?

                    Boosting energy efficiency via new technologies will help remedy global warming. This is because the main cause of global warming is energy required to operate, heat, and cool our buildings, companies, and industries. With the aid of energy-efficient technology, we can produce, provide, and enjoy ourselves to the same or greater degrees while using less energy. This strategy may be swiftly implemented and has great potential for energy and financial savings.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the past ten years, the transportation sector's emissions have risen more quickly than those of any other energy-consuming industry. There are several options to solve this problem, such as increasing the kilometer per liter efficiency across all modes of transportation, transitioning to low-carbon fuels, and lowering vehicle kilometres driven through smart planning and more effective mass transit networks.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, to achieve significant cuts in global emissions by the middle of the century, research and development of the following generation of low-carbon technologies will be essential. Recent advancements in battery technology, new solar cell materials, the use of energy from unorthodox sources like bacteria and algae, as well as other cutting-edge innovations, may be possible.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p  class="maincontent">
                    In summary, global warming is a serious and time-sensitive issue that must be tackled as soon as possible. Scientists predict that the Earth may be beyond saving by 2040 if the current global warming trend persists.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, we must all play our part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions which will in turn alter the current global warming pattern caused by excessive burning of fossil fuels, reforestation and nature destroying agricultural activities. 
                     <br><br>
                    As responsible human beings, we can participate in resforestation campaigns, protest the constructions of new coal power plants, switch to renewable energy sources when applicable and lastly use energy saving technologies. These are just a few steps that we can all take to play our part in stopping global warming.
                    <br><br>
                    There is still hope for us to save our planet if we all work together to make a difference. Although it may seem that this effort is futile for a single individual, the combined efforts of every individual on this planet will surely change our environment and climate for better.
